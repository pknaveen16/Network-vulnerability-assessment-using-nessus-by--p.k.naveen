# Network Vulnerability Assessment using Nessus

This project demonstrates the use of **Nessus** to perform a vulnerability assessment on a target network. Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanner that helps identify security flaws, misconfigurations, and weaknesses within a network infrastructure.

Overview

In this project, a comprehensive network vulnerability assessment is conducted using Nessus. The primary objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers and provide actionable remediation steps to mitigate those risks. The assessment includes:

- Scanning for open ports and services.
- Identifying outdated or vulnerable software.
- Detecting security misconfigurations in systems and network devices.

Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Nessus vulnerability scanner:

1. Download and install the Nessus scanner from the official website: [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus).
2. Register and activate Nessus for the appropriate license type (professional or community).
3. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pknaveen16/Network-vulnerability-assessment-using-nessus-by--p.k.naveen.git
   cd Network-vulnerability-assessment-using-nessus-by--p.k.naveen
   ```

4. Configure Nessus according to the network environment you wish to assess.

Usage

1. **Start Nessus**: Launch Nessus in your browser after installation (`https://localhost:8834`).
2. **Create a New Scan**: Select `New Scan` and configure it with the IP addresses or network ranges to be scanned.
3. **Launch the Scan**: Run the scan and monitor the progress.
4. **Analyze Results**: Once the scan is complete, analyze the results for vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or security gaps.
5. **Export Scan Results**: You can export the results in multiple formats (e.g., HTML, CSV, etc.) for further analysis or reporting.

Features

- Vulnerability Detection: Identifies CVEs, outdated software, and misconfigurations.
- Port Scanning: Scans for open ports and running services.
- Detailed Reports: Provides in-depth analysis and recommendations for remediation.
- Custom Scans: Supports creating custom scan policies to focus on specific areas of the network.

Requirements

- Nessus: Installed and configured on the system.
- Network Access: Ensure the scanning machine has appropriate access to the target network.
- Python (optional): If any automation or scripting is required for scanning or report parsing.
